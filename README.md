KTH course about Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning ( DD2437 - Pawel Herman )


# Data Format
X -> Data Matrix
- One row for each feature
- One column for each value

W -> Weight Matrix
- One row for each feature of the output data
- One column for each feature of the input data

Rules:
- Write the answer to the questions and comments into the group chat by quoting the question/task related

Tasks:
- Part 3.1
    - 3.1.1 Classification of linearly non-separable data  --> bruno 50%
        - Generate dataset 
        - Try different hidden nodes 
        - Sampling data to have a training dataset and a validation dataset
            -  Try different configurations and answer the 4 answers
            -  at least 3 cases for the number of hidden nodes
    - 3.1.2 Non-mandatory task ( skip for now )
    - 3.1.3 Function Approximation fatima 50%
        - Generate the input and output datapoints for the function 
        - Train the perceptron network 
            - Show the progress by visualising the output of the netwrok across the training patterns
            - Experiment with different number of nodes ( 5 tries ) in the hidden layer to see how this parameter affects the final representation.
        - Evaluate generalisation performance
            - Train the network with a limited number of available data points ( make a permutation of the vectors patterns and targets and choose only nsamp first patterns , trying different nsamp ).
            - Validate the performance by reporting the error on all the available data ( training and validation data ) and plot the resulting network's approximations in the 3D space
            - Report the error estimates of the 4 experiments
- Part 4
    - Generate Data zuzanna 100%
        - Pick 1200 points from t=301 to 1500
        - Divide the 1200 samples into 3 non overlapping blocks ( training, validation and testing )
        - Use the MSE as a measure of performance
    - Network Configuration zuzanna and fatima 100%
        - Build an MLP network with 5 inputs and one output 
        - Set up the training process with a batch backprop algorithm and early stopping to control the duration of learning ( using the error estimate on the hold-out validation data subset )
            -  If there are problems with the early stopping we can remove it or change it 
            -  Use regularisation technique like the weight decay ( choose a good library and explain its selection )
            -  Parametrize the number of hidden layes and numbers of layers 
            -  Use sigmoidal transfer functions in the hidden layers and a linear in the output
            -  Parametrize the regularisation method ( hyperparameter lambda ) and check for the speed of the convergence
    - Simulations and evaluation Zuzanna - Bruno 
        - check the performance of the best and worst architectures on test data  bruno
        - Add zero-mean Gaussian noise to training data bruno
        - use the best architecture & fix the number of nodes in the first hidden layer and vary the number of nodes in the second use the noise training data 
        - Add Gaussian noise for the validation data and see the performance of the models using this validation data 
        - 5 task skip
    - Report
        - Generate 3.1.1 plots - Bruno
        - Generate 4 plots - Fatima
        - Bruno does 3.1.1
        - Fatima does 3.1.3
        - Zuzanna and Fatima do part 4
    - Presentation -> Bruno
