# ANN-and-Deep-Learning
KTH course about Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning ( DD2437 - Pawel Herman )


# Data Format
X -> Data Matrix
- One row for each feature
- One column for each value

W -> Weight Matrix
- One row for each feature of the output data
- One column for each feature of the input data

Rules:
- Write the answer to the questions and comments into the group chat by quoting the question/task related

Tasks:
- Code for classic perceptron learning -> Bruno 
- Code for Delta Rule -> Bruno
- Adjust the learning rate and study the convergence of the two algorithms -> Fatima
- Compare sequential with a batch learning approach for the delta rule -> Fatima
- Remove the bias, train your network with the delta rule in batch mode and test its behaviour -> Bruno
3.1.3 Task
- Generation of non linear sample dataset -> Zuzanna
- Plot the samples -> Zuzanna
- Apply and compare perceptron learning and the delta rules using either batch or sequential learning mode, similarly as in the previous exercise -> Fatima
- Apply the delta learning rule in batch mode to this new dataset as well as to different versions of the subsampled data, i.e. before training please remove 25% -> Fatima
- Report -> Zuzanna
- Rewatch of the report -> Bruno/Fatima
